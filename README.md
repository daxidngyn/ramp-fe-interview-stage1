# Ramp Technical FE Interview - Stage 1

> For our Frontend focused live coding interviews, we evaluate candidates on their general knowledge of JavaScript (or TypeScript), HTML, CSS, and React. You may be asked to build a simple React app. You have the option to either use CodeSandbox or your local development setup (in which case, please create an empty Create React App project before the interview). You will need to share your screen for the interview (please have the Zoom app downloaded) and you are welcome to use Google at any point.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app), using [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) for styling.

I was responsible with building a day-calendar app with the following features:

- a time grid displaying times from 0-23 with events in each slot
- clicking on a specific time opens up a modal that allows for event creation
- clicking on an event opens up a modal that allows for event editting
- ability to delete events

This project showcases my progress during the interview stage and what I was able to complete. I was able to:

- showcase the time grid
- implement event creation
- open modal for event editting, however did not get to finish implementing it

After the interview, I refactored the app by finishing all of the goals set during the interview as well as restructuring the repo so that it is more organized. [Check it out here](/github/daxidngyn/ramp-fe-interview-stage1/post-interview).
